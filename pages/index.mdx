I am a Tech Lead expert in **empowering engineering teams** for **scale-up** founders.

As Senior Software Engineer, I got **{new Date().getFullYear()-2010} years** of experience in both **back-end** and **front-end** web development.

I love working on translating business outcomes into product ones and unblocking companies' potential through technology.

My culture focus and management style advocate for having engineers involved in the process as early as possible.
I'm all about impeccable agreements, kindness through clarity, and transparency.
